# coronasim

A simulator illustrating hospital resource exhaustion due to the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.

### Demo

The simulator is running [here](http://www.codercowboy.com/coronasim/). Althought, it's not really "running", as it's just static html + js that runs in your browser, anyway - there it is.

### Tech Stack

The simulator uses static html, javascript, and bootstrap 4.x. 

### Code Overview

POJO style classes are in classes.js. The simulator's code is in simulator.js. And, and a lot of utility code + the guts of the page are in lib.js.

### Want to Contribute?

Great. Please review the code. Please review my math. Please tell me I've made a serious error in the math and we're not as fucked as it seems.

I'm also tracking tasks / ideas in the TODO.md file, if you're interested in how you might contribute.
